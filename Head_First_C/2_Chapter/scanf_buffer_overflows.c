/*
* The scanf() function may cause buffer overflows.
* If you forget to limit the length of the string that you read with scanf(),
* then any user can enter far more data than the program has space to store.
* The extra data then gets written into memory that has not been properly
* allocated by the computer.
* Now, you might get lucky and the data will simply be stored and not cause any
* problems.
* But itâ€™s very likely that buffer overflows will cause bugs.
* It might be called a segmentation fault or an abort trap, but whatever the
* error message that appears, the result will be a crash.
* For example, if you just use %s in scanf(), there can be a problem if someone
* gets a little type-happy.
