## This is me learning C the hard way, so I have to give credit where credit is due:

Learn C The Hard Way by Zed Shaw

Thanks Zed!

This repo has a menagerie of projects written in the C language, each meant to be tinkered with, tickled, teased, poked, prodded, broken and fixed.

All of the code from Learn C The Hard Way, each project, plus the presentation slides used in the videos:
